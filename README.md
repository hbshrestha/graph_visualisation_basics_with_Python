# graph_visualisation_basics_with_Python

This repository contains the notebooks for graph visualisation basics with Python using packages such as `SchemDraw`, `NetworkX`, and `graphviz`. The notebooks are used for the following Medium posts in Towards Data Science:
- [Graph visualisation basics with Python Part I: Flowcharts](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/graph-visualisation-basics-with-python-part-i-flowcharts-6298c4f412e0)

- [Graph visualisation basics with Python Part II: Directed graph with NetworkX](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/graph-visualisation-basics-with-python-part-ii-directed-graph-with-networkx-5c1cd5564daa)

- [Graph Visualisation Basics with Python, Part III: Directed Graphs with graphviz](https://medium.com/p/50116fb0d670#3fdb-8fa0a16a2b41)

## Installation
- Download and clone this repository.

- The virutal environment can be created using: 

```conda env create -n graphs --file graphs-environment.yml```

- Once the environment is installed, it can be activated using:

```conda activate graphs```

- To create a kernel for the notebook:

```python -m ipykernel install --user --name graphs --display-name "graphs"```

## Uninstallation
If the environment is not required anymore, it can also be removed easily using:

```conda env remove -n graphs```

## To Do
- [X] Add notebooks for:
    - [X] Flowcharts
    - [X] Directed graphs using NetworkX
    - [X] Directed graphs using graphviz
